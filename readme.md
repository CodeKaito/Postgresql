# How to set up correctly the connect pb to node

To connect PostgreSQL to Node.js using the provided information, you can use the `pg` library, which is a popular PostgreSQL client for Node.js. Before you start, make sure to install the `pg` library:

```bash
npm install pg
```

Now, you can use the following code to establish a connection to PostgreSQL in your Node.js application:

```javascript
const { Pool } = require('pg');

const pool = new Pool({
  user: 'kaito',
  password: '060697',
  host: '192.168.1.21',
  port: 5432,
  database: 'people',
});

pool.query('SELECT current_user', (error, result) => {
  if (error) {
    console.error('Error executing query:', error);
  } else {
    const current_user = result.rows[0]['current_user'];
    console.log('Current user:', current_user);
  }

  // Don't forget to release the client back to the pool
  pool.end();
});
```

## Add pg_hba.conf Entry:

Ensure that your PostgreSQL server is configured to allow connections from your Node.js application. Add an appropriate entry to pg_hba.conf as explained in the previous response.

## Handle Connection Errors:

Wrap your code in a try-catch block to handle potential connection errors.

```
(async () => {
  const client = await pool.connect();
  try {
    const result = await client.query('SELECT current_user');
    console.log(result.rows[0]);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error executing query:', error);
  } finally {
    client.release();
  }
})();
```

## Firewall Settings:

Ensure that there are no firewall issues blocking the connection.
## Network Connectivity:

Verify that there is network connectivity between your Node.js application and the PostgreSQL server.
## PostgreSQL Server Status:

Make sure your PostgreSQL server is running and configured correctly.
## Database User Permissions:

Confirm that the specified database user has the necessary permissions.
## SSL Configuration (Optional):

Depending on your PostgreSQL setup, you may need to configure SSL settings in your connection pool.
## Secure Password Handling:

Consider using environment variables to securely handle sensitive information such as passwords.
## Configuration in Linux (pg_hba.conf):

1. Open the `pg_hba.conf` file in a text editor. The location of this file varies depending on your PostgreSQL installation. A common location is in the PostgreSQL data directory under the `pg_data` folder.

   ```bash
   sudo nano /path/to/pg_data/pg_hba.conf
   ```

   Replace `/path/to/pg_data/` with the actual path to your PostgreSQL data directory.

2. Add a new line to `pg_hba.conf` to permit the connection from the specified host. The line should look like this:

   ```
   host    people     kaito        192.168.1.4/32         md5
   ```

   - `host`: Specifies the connection type.
   - `people`: Specifies the name of the target database.
   - `kaito`: Specifies the name of the PostgreSQL user.
   - `192.168.1.4/32`: Specifies the allowed IP address range. You can adjust this based on your network configuration.
   - `md5`: Specifies the authentication method. In this case, it uses MD5-hashed passwords.

3. Save the changes to `pg_hba.conf` and close the editor.

4. After modifying `pg_hba.conf`, restart PostgreSQL to apply the changes:

   ```bash
   sudo service postgresql restart
   ```

Now, attempt to connect again from your Node.js application. The error should be resolved, and the connection should be allowed based on the updated `pg_hba.conf` configuration.
## Configuration in Linux (postgresql.conf):
Configuring `postgresql.conf` in PostgreSQL involves adjusting various settings to customize the behavior of your PostgreSQL server. Please note that modifying this file requires administrative privileges, and you should be cautious while making changes.

Here are the general steps to configure `postgresql.conf`:

1. **Locate `postgresql.conf`:**
   - The `postgresql.conf` file is typically located in the data directory of your PostgreSQL installation. Common paths include `/etc/postgresql/{version}/main/` or `/var/lib/pgsql/{version}/data/`.

   ```bash
   sudo nano /etc/postgresql/{version}/main/postgresql.conf
   ```

   Replace `{version}` with your specific PostgreSQL version.

2. **Make Changes:**
   - Inside `postgresql.conf`, you'll find various configuration parameters. Adjust the values based on your requirements.

   ```conf
   # Example: Listen on all available IP addresses
   listen_addresses = '*'

   # Example: Set the maximum number of connections
   max_connections = 100

   # Example: Adjust memory settings
   shared_buffers = 256MB
   ```

   Customize the values according to your system resources and needs. The comments within the file provide guidance on each parameter.

3. **Save and Exit:**
   - Save your changes and exit the editor.

4. **Restart PostgreSQL:**
   - After modifying `postgresql.conf`, restart the PostgreSQL server to apply the changes:

   ```bash
   sudo service postgresql restart
   ```

   Alternatively, you can use `pg_ctl`:

   ```bash
   sudo pg_ctl restart -D /var/lib/pgsql/{version}/data/
   ```

   Replace `/var/lib/pgsql/{version}/data/` with the actual data directory path.

Common Parameters to Consider:

- `listen_addresses`: Specifies which IP addresses to listen on. Set it to `'0.0.0.0'` to listen on all available addresses.
  
- `max_connections`: Sets the maximum number of concurrent connections.

- `shared_buffers`: Adjusts the amount of memory dedicated to PostgreSQL for caching.

- `work_mem`: Defines the amount of memory used for each operation in a query.

- `effective_cache_size`: Provides a hint about the amount of memory available for disk caching.

- `maintenance_work_mem`: Specifies the amount of memory used for maintenance operations.

It's important to refer to the official PostgreSQL documentation for a detailed explanation of each parameter: [PostgreSQL Configuration Settings](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/runtime-config.html).

Make changes carefully, and always have a backup of your `postgresql.conf` file before making modifications. Additionally, monitor the PostgreSQL logs (`pg_log` directory) for any warnings or errors after restarting the server.
